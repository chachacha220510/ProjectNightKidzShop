# Solution: Local Development Tools Without Affecting Deployment

This document explains how we've structured the repository to add local development tools while keeping them separate from the deployment configuration.

## The Problem

When running a Medusa.js e-commerce site across multiple environments, we faced these challenges:

1. Region ID mismatches between environments causing "Region not found" errors
2. Database schema differences requiring specific migrations and fixes
3. Need for easy import of production data into local development
4. Need to keep local development tools separate from deployment configuration

## Our Solution

We've implemented a two-pronged approach:

### 1. Local Development Tools (Not Deployed to Production)

These files are only used locally and don't affect deployment:

- `setup-local-db.js` - For initial setup and importing production data
- `restart-dev.sh` - For quick restart and fixing common issues
- `fix-regions.js` - For fixing region ID mismatches
- `docker-compose.yml` - For local Docker services
- Documentation files:
  - `LOCAL_DEV_README.md`
  - `REGION_ISSUES.md`
  - `SOLUTION.md`

All these files contain safety checks to prevent running in a production environment.

### 2. Clean Deployment Files (Used Only for Production)

The core Medusa.js application files remain untouched:

- `backend/` - Standard Medusa backend configuration
- `storefront/` - Standard Next.js storefront

## Separation of Concerns

To maintain this separation:

1. **Safety Checks**: Development scripts check for `NODE_ENV === "production"` and exit if detected
2. **No Cross-References**: Deployment code doesn't reference or depend on development scripts
3. **Clear Documentation**: Each tool's purpose and scope is well-documented
4. **Railway Deployment**: Follows standard Medusa deployment practices without custom workflows

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clean Repository**: Production deployment gets only what it needs
2. **Easy Onboarding**: New developers can quickly set up with one command
3. **Simplified Troubleshooting**: Common issues have easy-to-use fix scripts
4. **Environment Isolation**: Local development tools don't interfere with production

## Conclusion

By clearly separating local development tools from deployment code, we've created a development environment that:

1. Makes it easy to set up and maintain local instances
2. Solves common region ID and schema issues
3. Allows for easy production data imports
4. Doesn't interfere with production deployment

The development tools use Docker Compose to create a consistent environment, while the production deployment relies solely on the standard Medusa deployment process, ensuring that both environments work optimally without interfering with each other.
